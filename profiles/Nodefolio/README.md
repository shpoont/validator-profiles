## Our Architecture

NodeFolio is the premier solution for investors of all experience levels to operate their own validators. In short, we introduce real-time Node Running Rewards to your investment portfolio with NodeFolio. With Nodefolio, the most basic user receives free dashboarding and hourly reward sweeping that now makes the process of noderunning the simplest part of a users’ day.

In the staking world, secure keys work to provide daily rewards which yield passive income. NodeFolio offers the infrastructure for you to become a staked or oracle validator on any blockchain, allowing you reward and voting rights where applicable. Dedicated Bare Metal servers are the safest and most efficient method to running constantly validating nodes, and NodeFolio utilizes just that.
